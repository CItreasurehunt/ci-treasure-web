-- I-101 — DB data quality cron. One function running every check server-side (proper joins,
-- pg_trgm similarity, aggregation) so the Python caller just does one REST/RPC call and formats
-- the result -- no raw Postgres connection needed, matching how every other script in this repo
-- already talks to Supabase (service-role REST key), rather than introducing a new DB-password
-- secret for a single script. Each list-type check returns up to 10 rows plus a `_total` count so
-- the caller can show "top 10 + N more" without extra round-trips. Read-only: flags, never fixes
-- (see docs/issues/i-101-data-quality-cron.md).
